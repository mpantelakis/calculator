# Calculator
This project focuses on applying the knowledge acquired from the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript Foundations** courses of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to create a simple **calculator**.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in **DOM manipulation** and the effective use of **JavaScript events** to create dynamic and interactive webpage elements.
